Clinic Patient Management System
This program simulates a basic patient management system for a clinic. It allows clinic staff to manage patient records, categorize patients based on urgency, and interact with the data through a simple command-line interface. The system supports adding new patients, listing all patients, viewing the current queue, and searching patients by their mobile number.

Features
Add Patient: Enter details about a new patient, including their name, age, gender, blood type, medical problem, emergency status, and mobile number. The patient data is saved to a file (patients.csv) and added to either an emergency or regular queue based on their emergency status.
Take Patient to Doctor: Take the next available emergency patient or, if none exist, the next regular patient to see the doctor.
List All Patients: Display a list of all patients in the clinic, with separate lists for emergency patients and regular patients.
List Current Queue: Show the current queue of patients, prioritizing emergency cases.
Search by Mobile Number: Search for a patient by their mobile number and display their details if found.
File Persistence: Patient data is stored in a CSV file (patients.csv) to persist between program runs.
